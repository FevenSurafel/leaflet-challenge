# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet.js. The goal of the project is to create an interactive map that displays real-time earthquake data from the past week. The map features earthquake markers, where the size of each marker represents the earthquake's magnitude and the color corresponds to its depth below the Earth's surface. Users can click on individual markers to view additional details about the earthquake, such as its location, magnitude, and depth.
